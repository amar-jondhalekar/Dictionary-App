## How It Works

1. **Word Search**: Enter a word in the search input and click the search button. The app will fetch the word's details from the API and display them on the page. It also adds the word to your recent words list (stored in `localStorage`).
2. **Recent Words**: Displays the last five searched words. Each word can be clicked to quickly search for its details again.

3. **Favorite Words**: Users can add words to their favorites, which will be stored and displayed in a separate section.

4. **Dark Mode**: The app provides a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes. This option enhances the user experience, especially in low-light environments.
